* Nov 18, 2015 - TechCrunch Meet Up @Garage48HUB

Hello, I am Hannes, founder of Toitla.

We deliver happiness. Great idea to live for, just difficult to actually deliver. We found the way we are all familiar with, but which is just often missed opportunity. Food. We deliver food, which makes people happy. We found people, who can give such a form for the food. They are all around and among us. They really love what they do and in fact, they can't live without cooking. We can call them home cooks.

Today I am happy to present you snack made by Kristi and Kätlin. Kätlin is professional cook, who quit her job at the restaurant to cook for us. Kristi is actually newcomer, who was so happy about the order, that she really showed off tonight.

Enjoy your food served by Toitla, made by the best home cooks around and paid by the great sponsors of the event. Tell me what you think about it and one more thing. We have made it so far without any external funding, but we are hungry for more. World needs us and we are in a hurry. Therefore we are fundraising and looking for great people as angel investors to join our journey of happiness. We are planning to close our 250k € seed round early in Spring 2016. No matter who you are and what you do, life is all about happiness.
