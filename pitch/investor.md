WHAT
We bring together and organize home chefs to serve business events with best home made delicacies available.

WHY NOW
The sharing economy is booming. AirBnB and Uber are dominating in their field, there is no successful person2person food business yet. Many have tried, but failed or pivoted to another model.

WHY YOU
We are fully invested in our business. We've been testing and riding this thing for a year, only now it's starting to take off - we know what we're doing.

WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME
We need an advisory board with a broader understanding of building a global business funding to exponentially scale the business we've successfully built by hand.
