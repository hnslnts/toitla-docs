* Nov 18, 2015 - TechCrunch Meet Up @Garage48HUB

We met year ago with Krister and have been working with Toitla ever since. Lost some other founders on the way. We are now working full time with Toitla.

I am experienced entrepreneur with 8 years of management practice. Previously ran my own international company active in 8 countries and were responsible for fundraising, hub, events and hackathons at Garage48.

Krister Viirsaar is a software developer & Meteor pro with incredible pivoting skills. He was previously involved with developing national wide study system and worked with his own app for book publishers.
