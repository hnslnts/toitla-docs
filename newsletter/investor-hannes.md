It has taken too much time to write you. We met at Slush during the matchmaking rounds. We were the ones serving business events with the best home made bites available. We currently operate in Estonia, but aiming to built scalable global business to be clear. Find our one-pager and slide deck enclosed.

Read shortly below how are we doing. We are fundraising and we are planning to close our seed-round of 250,000€ within 1st half of 2016. If you could help us to connect with people from sharing economy (hassle.com Alex Depledge), cooking field (Jamie Oliver) or former/current startup entrepreneurs who could join our journey as investor or advisor would be awesome.

November, 2015 in action:
* We talked Uber into delivery. UberRUSH in not available in Europe and we developed work-around together with Uber to make delivery happen. It's working great for us. Uber loves us and we see great advantage of working with them in the food delivery before anyone else.
* We've outsourced the physical service to the trusted partner (setting the table, serving the guests and cleaning). We are working with them to optimize our service process, improve our branding and ensure the scalability of the physical service.
* We have released our web application to the cooks as private beta. Our app enables you to get customized menu and final price instantly considering your guests, events and best food available. It takes only a minute to place an order without any knowledge of food requirements or quantities.

November, 2015 in numbers:
* 6,100€ in revenue (+14,5%)
* Increase in the revenue per person served (+14,8%)f
* 5 out of 10 is recurrent order

Milestones for the next 3 months:
* 60 served events a month (6x growth)
* 60 dedicated cooks (6x growth)
* 30,000€ monthly revenue (5x growth)

Let us know, if you stop by Tallinn or Helsinki and we can meet in person. Or you are interested to hear more over quick Skype chat.

As you said at Slush, it's a race. We are entering into the era of sharing economy and it's about who's going to be there first. Airbnb and Uber are dominating their fields, but there is no clear leader in food business yet. We believe we have got a great start by focusing on solvent business customers and business events. This enables us to attract cooks with decent orders and good income. We have found our fans in case of both, among returning clients and dedicated cooks. Hope to get fans among investors as well ;)
