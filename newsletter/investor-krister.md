Hey,

It's been a while. We took some time to better understand our business and how to proceed.

As you know, we organize indipendent chefs around the city and serve the best food available. During one month since we met at slush we've outsourced delivery to Uber, outsourced service to trusted partners, optimized our ordering process for the client and currently we're using software to automate the time consuming process of putting together a specialized menu for the client. We're well on our way to fully automate the whole process from receiving the order to fulfilling it.

November, 2015 in the numbers:
6,100â‚¬ in revenue (+14,5%)
Revenue per people served +14,8%
5 out of 10 is recurrent order

We've decided to close an investment round this february. We could use your help to create an awesome pitch. Could you please have a look at our one-pager and tell us what you think? What could be improved? What's totally missing?
